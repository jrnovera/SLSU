        Our core values guide our work with the Katutubo communities. We prioritize authenticity, committing to faithfully documenting their true information and personal narratives. Through this, we aim for empowerment, supporting indigenous self-determination by providing well-organized and internally accessible data that aids their recognition. Every piece of collected data is approached with the utmost respect, ensuring cultural sensitivity and integrity. Our work is rooted in collaboration, as we work hand-in-hand with community members and local leaders during the data collection and verification processes. Finally, we believe in the power of education, using this technology to centralize knowledge for internal learning and informed decision-making within our project.
