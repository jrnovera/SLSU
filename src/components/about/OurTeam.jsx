          Our team consists of dedicated students from the College of Computer Studies at Southern Luzon State University. 
          We are passionate about using technology to preserve cultural heritage and support indigenous communities.
          Working closely with local leaders and community members, we've developed this information system to document
          and manage data for the Katutubo communities in Catanauan, Quezon.
